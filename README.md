# Lambda Practice with STL

This code is a practice exercise to demonstrate the usage of lambda functions with the C++ Standard Template Library (STL). 
It includes examples of lambdas being used with `std::for_each`, `std::transform`, `std::remove_if`, and sorting algorithms.

## Getting Started

To compile and run the code, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. Then, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/AMAN-ARABZADEH/STL-Lambda-Practice.git

2. Navigate to the project directory:

3. Compile the code using your preferred C++ compiler. For example, with `g++`:
g++ main.cpp -o main

4. Run the executable:
./main


## Code Explanation

- The code includes a `Person` class to demonstrate sorting based on different attributes.
- Lambdas are used with various STL algorithms such as `std::for_each`, `std::transform`, `std::remove_if`, and `std::sort`.
- The code provides output for each step to demonstrate the results.
